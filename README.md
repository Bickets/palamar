# dash-stack
Next generation cloud dash board for providers in mind.

This project is aiming for becoming de-facto customer portal and dash board for
providers with ease of use and multi tenancy support.

With dash-stack providers can package OpenStack as a product and start selling
cloud services with existing or newly installed OpenStack environment.
